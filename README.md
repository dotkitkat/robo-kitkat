# robo-kitkat
Robo KitKat is a bot made by me, `dotkitkat` for use on Discord servers I've joined.  
I'd prefer if you invited the public Robo KitKat instead of self-hosting, as it's not designed to be self-hosted, but you can still do it.  

# Inviting
Invite Robo KitKat with this link: *need to get around to hosting it*
